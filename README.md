# Heap-Sorting
As an exercise in learning what a heap is, I built a short c++ program to display and sort a heap for minimum and maximum values.


###What it does
This program is a simple implementation of a heapsort. It generates an array of random numbers, then sorts it step by step, using a heapsort.

The highlight of the program is that the heap is displayed as it is sorted, giving a visual representation of the sort.
